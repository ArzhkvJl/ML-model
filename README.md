# Linear Regression: Predicting Time to First Job After Graduation

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline using linear regression to predict how long it takes students to find their first job after graduation based on their academic performance (e.g., GPA or exam scores).

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict the number of months it takes for students to find their first job after graduation using academic performance as the main feature.
- **Approach:** The script uses a linear regression model, removes outliers to improve model fit, and visualizes the results.

## Files
- `linear_regression.py`: Main script for data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `xy_dataset.csv`: Example dataset containing academic performance and months to first job (generated by the script if not present).

## Dataset Format
The CSV file should have the following columns:

| x   | y   |
|-----|-----|
| GPA | Months to First Job |

- `x`: Academic performance (e.g., GPA or exam score)
- `y`: Number of months to first job after graduation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Ensure your dataset (`xy_dataset.csv`) is in the project directory, or let the script generate it.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Load the dataset
   - Train a linear regression model
   - Remove outliers until the model's RÂ² is above 0.5
   - Visualize the data and regression line
   - Print model statistics and predictions

## Output
- Console output with model statistics and predictions
- A plot showing the relationship between academic performance and months to first job

## Customization
- You can modify the dataset or script to use different features or targets as needed.
